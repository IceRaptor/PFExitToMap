# PFExitToMap
This mod for [Pathfinder Kingmaker](https://owlcatgames.com/) allows you to exit the map from any location. This is a direct copy 
of [Exit to Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/25) which appears to be unsupported at this point in time.

Note - when linking to UMM provided Harmony assemblies, **only** link `0Harmony12.dll`. If you link the other harmonies, you will get cryptic cast exceptions during loading. You've been warned!
